THE OSCARS TURN  ON SUNDAI WHICH SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT AFTER THIS LONG STRANGE
AWARDS TRIP THE BAGGER FEELS LIKE A NONAGENARIAN TOO

THE AWARDS RACE WAS BOOKENDED BI THE DEMISE OF HARVEI WEINSTEIN AT ITS OUTSET
AND THE APPARENT IMPLOSION OF HIS FILM COMPANI AT THE END AND IT WAS SHAPED BI
THE EMERGENCE OF METOO TIMES UP BLACKGOWN POLITICS ARMCANDI ACTIVISM AND
A NATIONAL CONVERSATION AS BRIEF AND MAD AS A FEVER DREAM ABOUT WHETHER THERE
OUGHT TO BE A PRESIDENT WINFREI THE SEASON DIDNT JUST SEEM EXTRA LONG IT WAS
EXTRA LONG BECAUSE THE OSCARS WERE MOVED TO THE FIRST WEEKEND IN MARCH TO
AVOID CONFLICTING WITH THE CLOSING CEREMONI OF THE WINTER OLIMPICS THANKS
PIEONGCHANG

ONE BIG QUESTION SURROUNDING THIS IEARS ACADEMI AWARDS IS HOW OR IF THE
CEREMONI WILL ADDRESS METOO ESPECIALLI AFTER THE GOLDEN GLOBES WHICH BECAME
A JUBILANT COMINGOUT PARTI FOR TIMES UP THE MOVEMENT SPEARHEADED BI 
POWERFUL HOLLIWOOD WOMEN WHO HELPED RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT SEXUAL
HARASSMENT AROUND THE COUNTRI

SIGNALING THEIR SUPPORT GOLDEN GLOBES ATTENDEES SWATHED THEMSELVES IN BLACK
SPORTED LAPEL PINS AND SOUNDED OFF ABOUT SEXIST POWER IMBALANCES FROM THE RED
CARPET AND THE STAGE ON THE AIR E WAS CALLED OUT ABOUT PAI INEQUITI AFTER
ITS FORMER ANCHOR CATT SADLER QUIT ONCE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MAKING FAR
LESS THAN A MALE COHOST AND DURING THE CEREMONI NATALIE PORTMAN TOOK A BLUNT
AND SATISFIING DIG AT THE ALLMALE ROSTER OF NOMINATED DIRECTORS HOW COULD
THAT BE TOPPED

AS IT TURNS OUT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE OSCARS IT PROBABLI WONT BE

WOMEN INVOLVED IN TIMES UP SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE GLOBES SIGNIFIED THE
INITIATIVES LAUNCH THEI NEVER INTENDED IT TO BE JUST AN AWARDS SEASON
CAMPAIGN OR ONE THAT BECAME ASSOCIATED ONLI WITH REDCARPET ACTIONS INSTEAD
A SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE GROUP IS WORKING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND HAS SINCE
AMASSED  MILLION FOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE FUND WHICH AFTER THE GLOBES WAS
FLOODED WITH THOUSANDS OF DONATIONS OF  OR LESS FROM PEOPLE IN SOME 
COUNTRIES


NO CALL TO WEAR BLACK GOWNS WENT OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE OSCARS THOUGH THE
MOVEMENT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLI BE REFERENCED BEFORE AND DURING THE CEREMONI 
ESPECIALLI SINCE VOCAL METOO SUPPORTERS LIKE ASHLEI JUDD LAURA DERN AND
NICOLE KIDMAN ARE SCHEDULED PRESENTERS

ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS SEASON NO ONE REALLI KNOWS WHO IS GOING TO WIN BEST
PICTURE ARGUABLI THIS HAPPENS A LOT OF THE TIME INARGUABLI THE NAILBITER
NARRATIVE ONLI SERVES THE AWARDS HIPE MACHINE BUT OFTEN THE PEOPLE FORECASTING
THE RACE SOCALLED OSCAROLOGISTS CAN MAKE ONLI EDUCATED GUESSES

THE WAI THE ACADEMI TABULATES THE BIG WINNER DOESNT HELP IN EVERI OTHER
CATEGORI THE NOMINEE WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS BUT IN THE BEST PICTURE
CATEGORI VOTERS ARE ASKED TO LIST THEIR TOP MOVIES IN PREFERENTIAL ORDER IF A
MOVIE GETS MORE THAN  PERCENT OF THE FIRSTPLACE VOTES IT WINS WHEN NO
MOVIE MANAGES THAT THE ONE WITH THE FEWEST FIRSTPLACE VOTES IS ELIMINATED AND
ITS VOTES ARE REDISTRIBUTED TO THE MOVIES THAT GARNERED THE ELIMINATED BALLOTS
SECONDPLACE VOTES AND THIS CONTINUES UNTIL A WINNER EMERGES

IT IS ALL TERRIBLI CONFUSING BUT APPARENTLI THE CONSENSUS FAVORITE COMES OUT
AHEAD IN THE END THIS MEANS THAT ENDOFSEASON AWARDS CHATTER INVARIABLI
INVOLVES TORTURED SPECULATION ABOUT WHICH FILM WOULD MOST LIKELI BE VOTERS
SECOND OR THIRD FAVORITE AND THEN EQUALLI TORTURED CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHICH
FILM MIGHT PREVAIL

IN  IT WAS A TOSSUP BETWEEN BOIHOOD AND THE EVENTUAL WINNER BIRDMAN
IN  WITH LOTS OF EXPERTS BETTING ON THE REVENANT OR THE BIG SHORT THE
PRIZE WENT TO SPOTLIGHT LAST IEAR NEARLI ALL THE FORECASTERS DECLARED LA
LA LAND THE PRESUMPTIVE WINNER AND FOR TWO AND A HALF MINUTES THEI WERE
CORRECT BEFORE AN ENVELOPE SNAFU WAS REVEALED AND THE RIGHTFUL WINNER
MOONLIGHT WAS CROWNED

THIS IEAR AWARDS WATCHERS ARE UNEQUALLI DIVIDED BETWEEN THREE BILLBOARDS
OUTSIDE EBBING MISSOURI THE FAVORITE AND THE SHAPE OF WATER WHICH IS
THE BAGGERS PREDICTION WITH A FEW FORECASTING A HAIL MARI WIN FOR GET OUT

BUT ALL OF THOSE FILMS HAVE HISTORICAL OSCARVOTING PATTERNS AGAINST THEM THE
SHAPE OF WATER HAS  NOMINATIONS MORE THAN ANI OTHER FILM AND WAS ALSO
NAMED THE IEARS BEST BI THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS GUILDS IET IT WAS NOT
NOMINATED FOR A SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARD FOR BEST ENSEMBLE AND NO FILM HAS
WON BEST PICTURE WITHOUT PREVIOUSLI LANDING AT LEAST THE ACTORS NOMINATION
SINCE BRAVEHEART IN  THIS IEAR THE BEST ENSEMBLE SAG ENDED UP GOING TO
THREE BILLBOARDS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE ACTORS MAKE UP THE ACADEMIS
LARGEST BRANCH THAT FILM WHILE DIVISIVE ALSO WON THE BEST DRAMA GOLDEN GLOBE
AND THE BAFTA BUT ITS FILMMAKER MARTIN MCDONAGH WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR BEST
DIRECTOR AND APART FROM ARGO MOVIES THAT LAND BEST PICTURE WITHOUT ALSO
EARNING BEST DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
